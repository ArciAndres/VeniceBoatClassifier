Venice Boat Classifier
=======================

Dataset
-----------------------
MarDCT Maritime Detection, Classification and Tracking data set
Can be downladed from: http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~labrococo/MAR/classification.htm

Description
-----------------------
Image classification problem with 21 boat categories, with provided train and test set. Several approaches were evaluated, mainly based on Convolutional neural networks (CNN), with Tensorflow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. 
To reproduce results, the dataset must be downloaded in the same folder, and follow the steps depicted on HW2-PrepareData.ipynb. Subsequently, HW2-ProcessData.ipynb can be processed.
